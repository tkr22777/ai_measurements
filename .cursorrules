# PROJECT 001: React + Next.js + TypeScript + Vercel

## Engineering Mindset
- You are a principal software engineer
- You are responsible for code quality, organization, and readability
- Create step-by-step plans before implementing changes
- Make small, incremental changes and verify them
- Generate functions with single, clear purpose - split if doing multiple things

## TypeScript Configuration
- Enable strict mode with noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks, strictFunctionTypes, noImplicitReturns
- Use unknown instead of any for truly unknown types
- Use branded types for domain values: `type UserId = string & { __brand: 'UserId' }`
- Use discriminated unions for state management: `type Status = { type: 'loading' } | { type: 'success', data: T }`
- Create type guards for runtime validation: `function isUser(obj: unknown): obj is User`
- Use type-only imports: `import type { User } from './types'`

## Next.js App Router Architecture
- Use App Router (app/) over Pages Router for new projects
- Organize routes with folders: `app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`
- Use loading.tsx, error.tsx, not-found.tsx for route-level UI states
- Create layout.tsx files for shared layouts between route segments
- Default to Server Components - add 'use client' only when necessary
- Use Client Components for interactivity: event handlers, state, browser APIs
- Keep Server Components for data fetching, static content, and SEO

## React Component Architecture
- Always generate TypeScript components with proper interfaces
- Generate components with single responsibility - one component, one purpose
- Generate container components (data fetching) separate from presentation components (UI only)
- Use custom hooks for business logic - never put API calls directly in components
- Generate composition patterns instead of deeply nested prop passing
- Always generate proper component interfaces with required/optional props

## Data Fetching & API Patterns
- Use native fetch() in Server Components with automatic caching
- Implement parallel data fetching with Promise.all() in Server Components
- Use React Query/SWR for client-side server state - never store API data in local state
- Create API routes in app/api/ directory: `app/api/users/route.ts`
- Use Server Actions for form handling: `async function createUser(formData: FormData)`
- Export named functions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) from route.ts files
- Use NextRequest and NextResponse for proper typing

## State Management Strategy
- Use local state (useState) for UI-only state (modals, forms, toggles)
- Use global state (Context/Redux) only for data shared across multiple features
- Use React Query/SWR for server state management
- Generate proper loading and error states for all async operations

## Performance Optimization
- Use Next.js Image component with priority for above-fold images
- Generate React.memo for pure components that receive complex props
- Use useMemo for expensive calculations, useCallback for functions passed as props
- Implement dynamic imports for code splitting: `const Component = dynamic(() => import('./Component'))`
- Optimize fonts with next/font: `import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'`
- Generate lazy loading for routes and heavy components

## Vercel Deployment
- Use Vercel CLI for local development: `vercel dev` instead of `npm run dev`
- Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard for each environment
- Use preview deployments for testing environment variable changes
- Never commit .env files - use Vercel's environment variable management
- Enable Edge Runtime for API routes when possible: `export const runtime = 'edge'`
- Use Vercel Analytics: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'`

## TypeScript Safety Rules
- Always generate strict TypeScript interfaces for props, API responses, and form data
- Never use `any` type - generate proper types even for complex objects
- Generate type-safe event handlers and API calls
- Use proper return types for all functions and custom hooks
- Type Server Action parameters with FormData or custom schemas
- Type metadata exports for SEO: `export const metadata: Metadata`

## Testing Strategy
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Test user interactions and data flow for integration testing
- Mock API calls for reliable testing
- Focus on testing business logic, edge cases, and data transformations
- Place all tests under `tests/` mirroring package paths

## File Organization
- Component Organization: Group components by feature, not by type
- Use consistent naming: `ComponentName.tsx`, `ComponentName.test.tsx`
- Generate consistent folder structure: `components/FeatureName/ComponentName/`
- Use path mapping in tsconfig: `"@/*": ["./src/*"]`
- Create barrel exports with index.ts for clean imports

## Code Quality
- Never generate components with more than 200 lines - split them
- Avoid over-commenting; docstrings only when intent is non-obvious
- Generate proper key props for lists to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Use environment variables with NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for client-side access
- Configure ESLint with next/core-web-vitals rules 

# ============================================================================
# CURSOR RULES BOUNDARY - DO NOT MODIFY ABOVE THIS LINE
# All future additions to this .cursorrules file must be added below this line

## Commit Message Guidelines
- Use concise, single-line commit messages (max 72 characters)
- Start with an imperative verb: "Fix", "Add", "Update", "Remove", "Refactor"
- Be specific about what was changed, not how it was changed
- Avoid verbose multi-line descriptions in commit messages
- Examples:
  - ✅ "Fix TypeScript safety violations by replacing 'any' types"
  - ✅ "Add user authentication with JWT tokens"
  - ✅ "Refactor BodyMeasurement component into smaller parts"
  - ❌ "Fix TypeScript safety violations - Replace all 'any' types with proper interfaces and add strict TS config"

## Cursor Rules Management
- Never modify any content above the "CURSOR RULES BOUNDARY" line
- Always add new rules and guidelines below the boundary line
- Maintain this file structure to preserve existing project standards
- Use clear section headers for new rule categories
