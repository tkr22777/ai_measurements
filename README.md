# Mobile Camera App

This is a mobile-friendly [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application that requests camera access and allows users to take photos using their device's camera.

## ðŸš€ Project Status & Code Quality Initiative

### âœ… **Recent Improvements (2025)**

- **TypeScript Safety**: Eliminated all `any` types, added strict compiler settings
- **Component Architecture**: Refactored 359-line BodyMeasurement component into 6 focused components (<200 lines each)
- **Code Standards**: Established comprehensive cursor rules and commit guidelines
- **File Organization**: Implemented feature-based component structure

### ðŸŽ¯ **Next Priority Actions**

1. **Client-Side State Management**: Implement React Query/SWR for API data caching
2. **Custom Hooks**: Extract remaining API calls from components to business logic hooks
3. **Testing Infrastructure**: Set up React Testing Library with comprehensive test coverage
4. **Performance Optimization**: Add React.memo, dynamic imports, and code splitting

### ðŸ“Š **Technical Debt Status**

- ðŸ”´ **Critical Issues**: 0/3 remaining (TypeScript safety âœ…, Component size âœ…)
- ðŸŸ  **High Priority**: 3 items pending (state management, component architecture, testing)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Priority**: 4 items pending (organization, performance, dev tools)

## Features

- Request camera permission with clear error feedback
- Mobile-friendly responsive design with PWA support
- Live camera preview with fullscreen experience
- Capture high-quality photos
- Upload photos to Vercel Blob Storage
- Image gallery with thumbnail views
- Download captured photos directly to your device
- Loading indicators for better UX
- Responsive UI for all device sizes
- Dark mode support
- PWA support for home screen installation

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and add your Vercel Blob token:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then update the `.env.local` file with your Vercel Blob token:

```
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_vercel_blob_token_here
```

To obtain a Vercel Blob token:

1. Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to Storage > Create a new Blob Store (or use an existing one)
3. Under the Blob Store settings, you can generate a token with read/write permissions

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Usage

1. The app will automatically request camera access when loaded
2. Grant permission when prompted by your browser
3. Once the camera preview is visible, click the large red button to take a photo
4. Review the captured photo and choose to "Retake" or "Upload to Server"
5. If you choose "Upload to Server", the photo will be stored in Vercel Blob Storage
6. After successful upload, you'll see a confirmation with a link to view the uploaded image

## Mobile Installation

For the best experience on mobile devices:

1. Visit the app in your mobile browser
2. Add it to your home screen (iOS: share > Add to Home Screen, Android: menu > Add to Home Screen)
3. Launch from your home screen for a fullscreen camera experience

## Important Notes

- Camera access requires HTTPS in production. For local development, http://localhost is trusted.
- Not all browsers support the camera API, particularly some older mobile browsers.
- Users must explicitly grant camera permissions for the app to work.
- For iOS users, PWA camera access is supported in iOS 14.3 and later.
- For Vercel Blob Storage to work in development, you need a valid BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN in your .env.local file.
- When deploying to Vercel, add the BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN to your environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

### Vercel Blob Storage

This app uses [Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob) for storing captured images. When deploying to Vercel:

1. Create a Blob Store in your Vercel dashboard
2. Add your BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN to your project's environment variables
3. Vercel will automatically handle the integration between your app and Blob storage

In different environments (development, preview, production), your images will be stored in separate directories automatically.

# Photo Display Components

This project provides several components for displaying user photos from blob storage:

## Components Overview

1. **PhotoSpots**: The main component used in the app for displaying front and side photos with interactive functionality to capture new photos.

2. **SimpleImageDisplay**: A simplified component that uses standard HTML img tags to display front and side photos fetched from blob storage.

## API Integration

These components interact with:

- `/api/images` - Fetches images by user ID and type (front or side)

## How Images Are Stored

Images are stored in Vercel Blob Storage with paths:

- `images/{userId}/front.{extension}`
- `images/{userId}/side.{extension}`

## Error Handling

All components include error handling for:

- Missing user ID
- Failed image loading
- API request failures

## Placeholder Images

When images fail to load, a placeholder SVG image is displayed instead.

## Using the SimpleImageDisplay Component

The SimpleImageDisplay component is the simplest way to display photos:

```jsx
import SimpleImageDisplay from '@/app/components/SimpleImageDisplay';

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <UserProvider>
      {/* Make sure to wrap the component with UserProvider */}
      <SimpleImageDisplay />
    </UserProvider>
  );
}
```

Note that it requires a userId to be set in the UserContext to function properly.

# Body Measurement Camera App

A React + Next.js + TypeScript camera application for body measurements, deployed on Vercel.

## Features

- Camera capture functionality
- Body measurement processing via Bodygram API
- TypeScript with strict type safety
- Modern React component architecture
- Vercel deployment ready

## Development

### Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Verification

Run the verification script to test core functionality:

```bash
npm run verify
```

This script will:

- Start the Next.js development server
- Test key API endpoints (/api/images, /api/process)
- Verify the home page loads correctly
- Report results and clean up

### Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run verify` - Run lightweight functionality tests

## Project Status âœ…

All critical issues have been resolved:

- âœ… **TypeScript Safety**: Replaced all 'any' types with proper interfaces
- âœ… **Component Architecture**: Refactored 359-line component into 6 focused components
- âœ… **Import Organization**: Fixed path mapping and standardized imports

**Next Priorities:**

1. React Query/SWR for server state management
2. Testing infrastructure (Jest + React Testing Library)
3. Error boundaries and loading states
4. Environment variable documentation

## Architecture

### Component Structure

- Container components handle data fetching and business logic
- Presentation components focus on UI only
- Custom hooks manage API calls and complex state
- TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety

### API Endpoints

- `/api/images` - Handle image upload and retrieval
- `/api/process` - Process body measurements via Bodygram API

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with:

```
BODYGRAM_API_KEY=your_api_key
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_vercel_blob_token
```

## Deployment

This project is configured for Vercel deployment with:

- Automatic builds on push
- Environment variable management
- Edge Runtime optimization
